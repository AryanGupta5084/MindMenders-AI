const { encrypt, decrypt } = require('../utils/crypto');

// Let's define the schema for a live chat message.
const liveChatMessageSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  // This links the message to a specific appointment session. It's how we'll group
  // all messages for a particular chat history.
  appointment: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Appointment', // This tells Mongoose the ID refers to a document in the 'Appointment' collection.
    required: true,
    index: true, // An index here is critical for performance, allowing us to quickly fetch all messages for an appointment.
  },

    // Just like with journal entries, we automatically encrypt messages before they're saved
    // and decrypt them when they're retrieved. This keeps the conversation content secure in the database.

  // Automatically add `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps. `createdAt` is perfect for showing when a message was sent.

  // applied when we send the message data back in an API response.

// Now, we compile our schema into a 'LiveChatMessage' model.
const LiveChatMessage = mongoose.model('LiveChatMessage', liveChatMessageSchema);
